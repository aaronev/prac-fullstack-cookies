### About

## Repo: prac-fullstack

This whole application is just for me to practice and see if I am capable of building a fullstack app with cleaner and more organized code. It started off as an assignment during my time at Learners Guild and this assignment was for the last interview to get me into the last phase and working on larger code base with a larger team. I had fun doing this so I want to continue doing it.# prac-fullstack-cookies

## Repo: (this) prac-fullstack-cookies

I'm using this repo to understand how cookies work and I have a basic understanding of it. It turns outs that you can add information to the cookies using a cookie parser. So whenever the user signs in, your setting the cookie parser to have the user id information to give the user authorization to do add a review or delete a review. Once the user signs out, it also clears the cookies.
