### About

This whole application is just for me to practice and see if I am capable of building a fullstack app with cleaner and more organized code. It started off as an assignment during my time at Learners Guild and this assignment was for the last interview to get me into the last phase and working on larger code base with a larger team. I had fun doing this so I want to continue doing it.# prac-fullstack-cookies
